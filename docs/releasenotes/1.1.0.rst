==============
Typelets 1.1.0
==============

**Release date:** December 9, 2025

typelets.funcs
==============

Added :py:func:`~typelets.funcs.type_func_params_as` and
:py:func:`~typelets.funcs.type_method_params_as`, which can be used as
decorators to "inherit" the typing from one function to another. This will
automatically apply typing to ``*args`` and ``**kwargs`` to match the
annotations that exist on another function.

These do have some limitations on usage and compatibility. See the
documentation for each of the methods for details.


typelets.json
=============

Fixed up some type definitions which were incompatible with Python 3.8.


typelets.runtime
================

Added the new :py:mod:`typelets.runtime` module, which contains utilities for
working with types at run-time (as opposed to just type-checking).

This contains a new method, :py:func:`~typelets.runtime.raise_invalid_type`,
which works a lot like :py:func:`typing.assert_never`, but allows raising
exceptions other than :py:class:`AssertionError`. This makes it easier to write
code which performs runtime checking for defensiveness while also satisfying
type checkers that do dead-code checks.
